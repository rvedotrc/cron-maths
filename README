Quick hacky script to calculate how often cron jobs run, by reading the
crontab.

"times-per-day" reads lines from standard input, where each line should be in
crontab form (e.g. "7,27 9-17 * * * do-something").  Each line is echoed to
standard output, but preceded by the number of times this job runs per day
(the day-of-week, day-of-month and month fields are ignored).

e.g. given input

  */5 * * * * do-something-one
  21 9-16 * * * do-something-two

then the output is

  288 */5 * * * * do-something-one
  8 21 9-16 * * * do-something-two

because the first job runs 288 times per day, and the second one runs 8 times
per day.
